    "For the purpose of this tutorial, we compute three climate indices: aridity, phase, and seasonality.\n",
    "Thus, we need to retrieve precipitation and potential evapotranspiration time series. We use [PyNLDAS2](https://docs.hyriver.io/readme/pynldas2.html). Note that NLDAS2 has a spatial resolution of 0.125 degree, so drainage area of most of our stations, are probably going to be within few pixels. Therefore, it's not really necessary to get gridded data for each station watershed and a single pixel, would be enough. Although, using 20 or 30 years of climate data works better, we use only 10 years (2000-2010) so the notebook runs faster. Feel free to increase the time period.\n",

    "Since we are getting 10 years of hourly climate data for 531 stations, it's going to be memory intensive, and of course, time-consuming. Considering that we only need the aridity, phase, and seasonality index values, and not the actual climate data, it's more efficient to retrieve stations' climate data in chunks, compute the indices, and store them.\n",
    "\n",
    "We compute the aridity index using [Budyko, 1974](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/quaternary-research/article/abs/climate-and-life-m-i-budyko-david-h-miller-translator-academic-press-new-york-3500/41572608FC33C2AA6EFD4D0AF96AF927), the phase index using a simple Spearman correlation coefficient between mean monthly summaries of $P$ and $E_p$, and seasonality index using [Walsh and Lawler, 1981](https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1477-8696.1981.tb05400.x) method.\n",
    "\n",
    "If mean monthly correlation is positive, we assume in-phase, otherwise out-of-phase. Although, technically, the threshold for in-phase is 0.3, for out-of-phase -0.3, and in-between no-phase, we use 0.0 as the threshold for simplicity and, more importantly, matching the table from [Apurv et al., (2017)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/2017WR021445). They used a bit more complex method that detects in/out of phase and there's no no-phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "For precipitation seasonality index, the threshold is 0.6, based on the following table from [Walsh and Lawler, 1981](https://doi.org/10.1002/j.1477-8696.1981.tb05400.x).\n",

However, `hydrosignatures.compute_ai` computes the inverse of UNEP's definition which is common in the hydrology literature. So, we need to invert the index before using it.\n",
